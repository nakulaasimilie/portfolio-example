        <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
           practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so 
           that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

        <div class="box">
         <h1 class="headings">Back-End<br> Development</h1>
        <p>Back-end development means working on server-side 
          software, which focuses on everything you can't see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming
           interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.</p>
